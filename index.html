<p>Ya Qin Li, a longtime tenant of a mixed-use building on Bowery Street in Manhattan's Chinatown, has been dealing with water leaks, an irregular gas supply and gradually worsening living conditions for several years now.</p>

<p>Her building, along with nine others on the same street, was sold to a developer for $62 million in 2013. Since then, her landlord has allowed the building to fall into disrepair, she said at a recent rally protesting the construction of a luxury condominium on Cherry Street.</p>

<p>"The developer also started to kick some of us out; he wants to take down our buildings and build luxury high rises," she said. "We are being displaced by landlords and developers. This is not something I can afford."</p>
